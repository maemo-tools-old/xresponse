xresponse
====

'xresponse' is a simple tool for meassuring UI response times to a
full mouse click event. It requires the Xtest, to 'fake' the mouse
and keyboard events, and XDamage, to report areas of the display
that have changed.


Building
====

Its recommended you have the freedesktop.org autotooled xlibs
installed with pkg-config (.pc ) files for xlibs, xext, xtst and
xdamage. Then it should be a case of the usual ./configure, make and
make install.


Usage
===

xresponse <-o|--logfile output> [commands..]

Commands are any combination/order of;

-c|--click <XxY>                Send click and await damage response
-d|--drag <XxY,XxY,XxY,XxY..>   Simulate mouse drag and collect damage
-k|--key <keysym,delay>         Simulate pressing and releasing a key
                                Delay is in milliseconds
-m|--monitor <WIDTHxHEIGHT+X+Y> Watch area for damage ( default fullscreen )
-w|--wait <seconds>             Max time to wait for damage, set to 0 to
                                monitor for ever. 
                                ( default 5 secs)
-s|--stamp <string>             Write 'string' to log file
-t|--type <string>              Simulate typing a string
-i|--inspect                    Just display damage events
-v|--verbose                    Output response to all command line options


Examples
===

Click mouse at 100,100 and collect max 5 seconds of damage events;

% xresponse -c 100x100

Click and hold mouse at 100,100, then move to 101,100, then 105,100,
then 110,100 and finally release mouse. Damage is collected between
each point with max 5 seconds.

% xresponse -d 100x100,101x100,105x100,110x100

Click the mouse at 100x100, 100x150 and 200x200 colecting a max second
of damage for each only in 240x320+0+0;

% xresponse -w 1  -m 240x320+0+0 -c 100x100 -c 100x150 -c 200x200

Monitor all damage for ever;

% xresponse -w 0 -i

Monitor only top corner of screen for 10 seconds, then send a click collecting
5 seconds of damage

% xresponse -w 10 -m 240x320+0+0 -i -w 5 -c 100x100

Simulate pressing the F4 key with half a second between the keypress and
-release;

% xresponse -k F4,500

Simulate typing the string 'Testing';

% xresponse -t Testing

Tips
===

- you can use 'xmag' to figure out screen co-ords for window clicks.

- you can use 'xev' to figure out what keysym is needed to simulate a
  press of certain key (note that for most alphanumeric characters,
  the keysym is just the same one-character symbol, e.g. 'a' key without
  modifiers has keysym of 'a').
